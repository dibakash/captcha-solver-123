# Captcha Solver\n\nThis is a simple single-page web application designed to solve a specific image-based captcha. It provides a user interface to display a captcha image and allows the user to input their guess. The application validates the input against the expected captcha value.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-first, and responsive user experience.\n*   **Dynamic Image Loading**: Loads captcha images from a `url` query parameter or defaults to a local `sample.png`.\n*   **Client-Side Validation**: Compares user input against the hardcoded correct captcha value ("ADCR3").\n\n## How to Run\n\n1.  **Save the files**: Ensure `index.html`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `sample.png` are all in the same directory.\n2.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.\n\n## Usage\n\nWhen you open `index.html`:\n\n*   By default, the application will display the `sample.png` image.\n*   An input field will be available for you to type the characters shown in the captcha.\n*   Click "Submit" to check your answer.\n\n### Loading Custom Captcha Images\n\nYou can load a captcha image from an external URL by appending a `url` query parameter to the `index.html` file in your browser's address bar.\n\n**Example:**\n`file:///path/to/your/folder/index.html?url=https://example.com/your-captcha-image.png`\n\nMake sure the image at the provided URL is publicly accessible.\n\n## Expected Captcha\n\nThe expected solution for the captcha in `sample.png` (and any other image you might provide) is **`ADCR3`**.\nThe solver performs a case-insensitive comparison.\n
